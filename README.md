# Demand-Forecasting-and-Inventory-Optimisation

## AIM
Predicting the Future of Product Sales and Crafting the Optimal Inventory Strategy.

## Introduction
Navigating the ever-shifting landscape of customer demand is a core challenge that supply chain professionals face. Supply chain professionals often combine their expert intuition with some basic statistical techniques to infer the demand for products based on historical data. This process is relatively straightforward when dealing with smaller product categories and stable demand patterns. However, As businesses grow and encounter larger product categories with constantly shifting consumer demands, this traditional demand forecasting approach may not scale.

In this notebook, we will explore a more modern and scalable alternative â€“ a data-driven, programmatic approach to demand forecasting. We will build a demand forecasting model with Python. We will also use this model for inventory optimization, covering concepts like reorder points, safety stock, and economic order quantity (EOQ).

Throughout this project, we will address two key business questions:

- What is the demand forecast for the top-selling product in the next 12 months?
- What is the optimal inventory level for the product?

## Project Outline
For this project, I completed the following tasks:

- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Cleaned and Prepared the data for modeling.
- Conducted Time Series Modeling With Prophet.
- Evaluated the model performance.
- Interpret the model results and answer the business questions
